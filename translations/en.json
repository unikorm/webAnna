For six months, I rejoiced in my successes, but then circumstances led me to move to Slovakia. Starting my path in photography in a new country proved to be a challenge, but I am ready to overcome all difficulties. I believe that true art is born out of love and dedication to one's craft. I strive to grow and improve to continue embodying my passion in every frame and make photography my permanent profession.",
