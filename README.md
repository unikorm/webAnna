I am happy to introduce a new essential feature â€“ the contact form is finally working! What's next? I need to complete the portfolio section, create content for the pricing list, overall polish the page's styling, and then take care of numerous other details. Additionally, as I learn new things, I'll be modifying and updating the existing code.  


*Photography website for my wife already to reach more clients and simplify the process of sending her orders. 
Design of the site will be very simply and minimalistic with contact form, portfolia section with some her top photos, some bio - information about her, homepage with big wallpaper, etc.*
